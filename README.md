# Student-Score-Prediction
# Objective

To build a predictive model that estimates a student’s exam score using key learning habits such as study hours.

## Steps Involved

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing — Handling missing values and formatting data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — Understanding relationships via visualizations

Model Training — Implementing Linear Regression using scikit-learn

Evaluation — Measuring performance with MAE, MSE, and R² metrics

Visualization — Plotting actual vs predicted exam scores

## Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

## Results

Built a regression model that accurately predicts student exam performance

Visual insights show a strong positive relationship between study hours and scores
